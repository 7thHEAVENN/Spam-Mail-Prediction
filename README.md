# Spam mail prediction
A spam mail prediction project report is a document that summarizes the process and results of a project that aims to identify and classify spam emails. The project would typically involve collecting and preprocessing large amounts of data, such as email messages and their labels (i.e. spam or not-spam). The report would likely include information on the methods used to preprocess the data and the techniques used to train and evaluate the model. Additionally, the report would likely include information on the performance of the model, such as accuracy and precision, and any challenges encountered during the project. Finally, the report may also include recommendations for further research or improvements to the model. Overall, the report should be well-organized, clearly written and provide a detailed overview of the project's methods and results.
